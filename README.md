# TensorFlow-DeepLearning
## TensorFlow and Deep Learning Fundamentals with Python
Welcome to this repository focused on TensorFlow and Deep Learning fundamentals!

This repository explores the concepts covered in the following YouTube videos:

**Video 1:** [part-1] (https://youtu.be/tpCFfeUEGs8?si=lp4adyKkcTC5GVgI)

**Video 2:** [part-2] (https://youtu.be/ZUKz4125WNI?si=0-il7WZMOHq0D0qy)

These videos provide a fantastic introduction to building and training neural networks using TensorFlow.

### What's Included?

Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) that walk you through the code and concepts presented in the videos.

Notes for the video tutorials. Check out the complete [notes](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) (Or fork a copy if needed!) provided by [@mrdbourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke).
### Project Structure:

Each Jupyter Notebook corresponds to a specific video in the playlists. The notebooks are well-commented and designed to be clear and easy to follow.

### Feel free to:

* Run the existing notebooks to gain hands-on experience.
* Modify the code to experiment with different parameters and concepts.
* Contribute your own notebooks or improvements (pull requests welcome!).
### Get Started:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open Google colab and navigate to the desired notebook.
3. Run the code cell by cell or experiment with modifications.

## Happy learning!
